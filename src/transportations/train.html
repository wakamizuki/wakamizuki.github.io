                                    <p> <b>Using IC Cards:</b><br />
                                        In Japan, IC cards like "Suica" and "PASMO" are very convenient. By pre-charging these cards, you can simply touch them to the station ticket gates to board the train. You can purchase them at station ticket machines or convenience stores.<br />
                                        ※ There is no need to buy a ticket if you are using an IC card.<br />
                                        <b>Buying Tickets:</b><br />
                                        If you don't have an IC card, you can buy a paper ticket at an automatic ticket machine. Check the fare to your destination and purchase a ticket for that fare at the machine. Most stations have English displays, so you can select your preferred language to operate the machine.<br />
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                        <b>Check the route map:</b><br>
                                        Many cities have multiple train lines intersecting. Stations typically have large route maps, some of which include English labels. You can also use apps like Google Maps or NAVITIME to check train routes.<br />
                                        <b>Check the station platform:</b><br>
                                        Check which platform the train to your destination departs from. Stations have signs displaying the train's destination and departure time.<br>
                                        <b>Pay attention to the time:</b><br>
                                        Trains in Japan are very punctual. You can check the timetable on each station's platform or on the website.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>When using an IC card:</b><br>
                                        Tap your card on the ticket gate. The balance will be displayed as you pass through, so make sure to recharge it in advance if necessary.<br>
                                        <b>When using a ticket:</b><br>
                                        Insert the purchased ticket into the ticket gate, and take the ticket that comes out as you pass through. The ticket will be collected at the ticket gate at your destination, so be careful not to lose it.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Wait on the platform:</b><br>
                                        Wait for the train inside the yellow line. In Japan, it is common practice to line up in an orderly manner.<br>
                                        <b>When the doors open:</b><br>
                                        Let the passengers exit first before boarding the train. Once inside, you can either take a seat or stand and hold onto the handrail.<br>
                                        <b>Mind your manners:</b><br>
                                        It's important to be quiet inside the train. Set your mobile phone to silent mode and avoid making calls. Also, give up priority seats to those who are physically disabled, elderly, or pregnant.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Pay attention to announcements:</b><br>
                                        There are announcements inside the train to inform you of the next station, and often these are available in English as well. Listen carefully to confirm your stop.<br>
                                        <b>If you need to transfer:</b><br>
                                        Transfer information is indicated on station signs, so follow them accordingly. When switching to a different line, check the platform again before boarding the next train.

                                        <b>When using an IC card:</b><br>
                                        Tap your card on the ticket gate at your destination station to exit. If the balance is insufficient, use a recharge machine or ask the station staff for assistance.<br>
                                        <b>When using a ticket:</b><br>
                                        Insert the ticket into the ticket gate and proceed to the exit.
                                    </p>

                                        <b>Consult the station staff:</b><br>
                                        Most stations have "Information Desks" or "Information Counters," and some staff members may speak English. If you have any issues, feel free to ask the station staff for help.
