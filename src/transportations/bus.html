                                    <p> <b>Bus stop locations:</b><br /> 
                                        Bus stops are usually located near train stations, large buildings, or intersections. They are marked with a sign that shows the bus routes and numbers.<br /> 
                                        <b>Bus route numbers:</b><br /> 
                                        Each bus has a route number displayed on the front of the bus. Make sure the number matches the one you need for your destination.<br />                                         
                                    </p>                                        
                                </div>

                                    <h2 class = "flow" id = "flow2">2. Boarding the Bus</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>From the front or rear door:</b><br>
                                        In most cities, passengers board from the front door and pay when they get on. However, in some rural areas, passengers board from the rear door and pay when getting off. Check how passengers are boarding before you enter.<br />
                                        <b>Taking a ticket:</b><br>
                                        In areas where you board from the rear door, you may need to take a ticket from the machine near the door. This ticket has a number that indicates where you got on.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <h2 class = "flow" id = "flow3">3. Paying the Fare</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Flat-rate fare:</b><br> 
                                        In some cities, like Tokyo or Kyoto, the bus fare is a flat rate, regardless of distance. You pay the fare when you board the bus. Use cash, an IC card like Suica or PASMO, or in some cases, a bus pass.<br />
                                        <b>Distance-based fare:</b><br>
                                        In other cities or rural areas, the fare is based on the distance you travel. When you get off, compare the number on your ticket with the fare chart displayed at the front of the bus. Pay the correct fare before exiting.<br />
                                        <b>Using an IC card:</b>
                                        If you’re using an IC card (Suica, PASMO, etc.), simply tap the card on the reader when you board (and sometimes when you get off, depending on the city). The fare will be automatically deducted from your card.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <h2 class="flow" id="flow4">4. During the Ride</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Bus stops:</b><br />
                                        Bus stops are announced both visually and audibly. Some buses have announcements in English, especially in tourist areas. Press the stop button near your seat when your stop is announced or displayed.<br />
                                        <b>Manners:</b><br />
                                        Keep quiet on the bus, and be mindful of your surroundings. It’s polite to offer your seat to elderly passengers, pregnant women, or those with disabilities.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Paying the fare:</b><br />
                                        If you boarded from the rear door, pay the fare when you exit from the front. Insert the correct amount of cash or use your IC card. If you're paying in cash and don’t have the exact amount, there is usually a machine near the driver that can change larger bills into coins.<br />
                                        <b>Exit:</b><br />
                                        In most cases, you exit through the front door. If you have luggage, be sure to grab it before you leave.
