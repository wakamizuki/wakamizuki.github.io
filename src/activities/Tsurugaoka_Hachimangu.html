                            <p>
                                Tsurugaoka Hachimangu has a history of over 800 years and is closely associated with
                                Minamoto no Yoritomo, the first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate. Originally established
                                when Minamoto no Yoriyoshi, Yoritomo's ancestor, enshrined the deity from Iwashimizu
                                Hachimangu in Kyoto at Yuigahama, the shrine was later relocated to its current site by
                                Yoritomo himself. Deeply revered by the samurai class, Tsurugaoka Hachimangu became a
                                symbol of martial valor and victory, attracting widespread devotion as a guardian of
                                warriors.
