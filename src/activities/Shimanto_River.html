                                The Shimanto River, flowing through Kochi Prefecture in Shikoku, is celebrated as
                                “Japan’s last clear stream.” Unspoiled by dams, its crystal-clear waters wind through
                                lush countryside, traditional villages, and iconic low-water bridges (“chinkabashi”).
                                The river is a paradise for outdoor lovers, offering canoeing, cycling, fishing, and
                                riverside camping. Its tranquil scenery and slow pace make it a perfect escape from city
                                life.
