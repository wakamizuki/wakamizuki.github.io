                                Matsumoto Castle, one of Japan’s most iconic original castles, is known for its striking
                                black exterior, earning it the nickname “Crow Castle.” Built in the late 16th century,
                                it stands as a National Treasure of Japan. Visitors can explore the interior wooden
                                structure, climb steep stairs to the top, and enjoy panoramic views of the Japanese
                                Alps. It’s a perfect blend of history, architecture, and scenic beauty.
