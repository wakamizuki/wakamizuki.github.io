                            <h2>Access to Magome-juku by <strong>Highway Bus</strong> (Last updated: May 12, 2025)</h2>
                            <p>
                                The most convenient way to reach Magome-juku is by highway bus. Take a direct highway
                                bus from Busta Shinjuku (Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal) to Nakatsugawa Station. From
                                Nakatsugawa, transfer to a local bus bound for Magome-juku. This route is comfortable
                                and often more affordable than taking the train, especially for those traveling from
                                Tokyo.
