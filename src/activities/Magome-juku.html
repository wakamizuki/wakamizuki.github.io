                                One of the most popular specialties is <strong>gohei-mochi</strong>, which comes in
                                various shapes such as the classic “waraji” (sandal) or round dumpling style. The
                                mochi is coated with a rich sauce made from soy sauce or miso, blended with walnuts,
                                peanuts, or sesame, and then carefully pounded and grilled. The result is a
                                fragrant, chewy treat loved by visitors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each shop has its own secret recipe for the sauce, so tasting and comparing
                                different gohei-mochi is highly recommended!

                                            <li><strong>November to April:</strong> Down jacket, 🧤gloves, sweaters, and
                                                other warm clothing are essential. Temperatures can be very low, so
                                                please take adequate precautions against the cold.</li>
                                            <li><strong>April:</strong> There can be some warm days, so we recommend
                                                wearing layers that you can adjust easily.</li>
                                            <li><strong>May, June, September, October:</strong> A light jacket or jumper
                                                and long sleeves are recommended, as temperatures can fluctuate. Bring
                                                layers you can easily add or remove. The sun can be strong, so consider
                                                bringing a sun hat, sunglasses, or a light scarf for extra protection.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>July & August:</strong> 🕶️Sunglasses, a hat, and a light jumper
                                                are recommended. A scarf or shawl that can be adjusted is useful.
                                                Weather can change quickly, so bringing rain gear is also advised.</li>
