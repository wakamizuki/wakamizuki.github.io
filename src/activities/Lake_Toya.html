                            <p>
                                Lake Toya (洞爺湖, Tōya-ko) is a stunning caldera lake in southwestern Hokkaido, surrounded
                                by mountains and volcanic landscapes. The lake is famous for its crystal-clear waters,
                                scenic cruises, and lakeside hot spring resorts. Mount Usu, an active volcano, rises
                                nearby, offering panoramic views and hiking trails. The area is also known for its
                                long-running summer fireworks festival and outdoor activities such as cycling, canoeing,
                                and nature walks. For more ideas on what to see nearby, check out the "Find Recommended

                            <p>
                                Lake Toya was formed by a volcanic eruption over 100,000 years ago. The area has long
                                been cherished for its natural beauty and healing hot springs. The indigenous Ainu
                                people regarded the lake as sacred. Today, Toyako Onsen town welcomes visitors with
                                lakeside baths and local hospitality. The region’s volcanic activity is showcased at the
                                Mount Usu Geopark, a UNESCO Global Geopark.

                                the lake’s guardian are held throughout the year.

                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Tip:</strong> Get off at <em>Toyako Onsen</em> for easy access to hotels,
                                    the lakefront, and sightseeing cruises.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Walking from Toya Station to the lake area is possible (about 9 km, 2 hours), but
                                    the bus is much more convenient, especially with luggage.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once in Toyako Onsen, all major attractions, hotels, and the lakeshore are easily
                                    accessible on foot.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Exploring the lakeside promenade is highly recommended for enjoying the scenery,
                                    local shops, and the famous fireworks in summer.
