                                Treasures, including ancient Buddhist statues and scriptures, as well as a beautiful
                                three-story pagoda. Its tranquil setting and rich history attract visitors seeking both

                                One of the temple’s cultural highlights is a traditional poem known as a

                                written in the classical <em>tanka</em> style. The poem praises the serene beauty and
                                deep spiritual presence of
                                Amanosan Kongoji, expressing awe at its long and sacred history. Recited by pilgrims and
                                visitors, it reflects the
                                temple’s enduring role as a place of reverence and reflection.
