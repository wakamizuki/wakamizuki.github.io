                                Iya Valley is one of Japan’s most secluded and breathtaking regions, tucked away in the
                                mountains of Shikoku. Known for its dramatic gorges, vine bridges (kazurabashi), and
                                untouched countryside, the valley offers a glimpse into rural Japan’s wild beauty.
                                Visitors can cross swaying vine bridges, soak in hot springs, and explore remote
                                villages that seem frozen in time.
