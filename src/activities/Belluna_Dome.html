                                Belluna Dome, also known as MetLife Dome in the past, is the home stadium of the Saitama
                                Seibu Lions, located in Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan.
                                Known for its unique structureâ€”partially open-air with a roofâ€”it provides a distinct
                                baseball experience that blends the indoors and outdoors.
                                It offers not only thrilling baseball games but also seasonal events and scenic
                                surroundings in Seibu-en area.

                            <h2> How to Get to Belluna Dome by TrainðŸšƒ(Best Option!, Last updated: May 12, 2025)</h2>
                            <p>
                                For international visitors, taking the train is the most recommended way to reach
                                Belluna Dome. Not only is it
                                convenient and reliable, but it also allows you to enjoy a cold beer at the game without
                                worrying about driving.
                                Since the dome is located in Tokorozawa, about an hour from central Tokyo, taking a taxi
                                would be quite expensive.
                                The nearest station, Seibu-Kyujomae Station, is directly connected to the stadium,
                                making train travel the easiest
                                and most stress-free option.
