                                Hakone Shrine, nestled along the serene shores of <a href="Ashinoko_Lake.html"
                                    class="pink-link">Lake Ashi</a>, traces its origins to
                                Mototsumiya, the original
                                sanctuary perched atop Mt. Komagatake. Established in 757, the shrine was initially
                                located at this mountaintop
                                site, where the deities were first enshrined. Historically, pilgrims would ascend to
                                Mototsumiya to pay homage
                                before descending to worship at the lakeside Hakone Shrine. This pilgrimage embodies a
                                spiritual journey from the
                                heavens to the earth, symbolizing the profound connection between the mountain and the
                                lake. Together, Mototsumiya
                                and Hakone Shrine represent the harmonious blend of nature and spirituality that defines
                                the sacred heritage of the
                                Hakone region.
