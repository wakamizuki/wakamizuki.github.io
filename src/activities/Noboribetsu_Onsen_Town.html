                            <p>
                                Noboribetsu Onsen Town (登別温泉街), nestled at the foot of Mount Hiyori in southwestern
                                Hokkaido, is Japan’s most famous hot spring resort. The town boasts a remarkable variety
                                of mineral-rich hot springs, each with unique healing properties. The dramatic volcanic
                                landscape of Jigokudani (“Hell Valley”) provides a surreal backdrop, with steaming vents
                                and bubbling pools. Visitors can enjoy traditional ryokan stays, open-air baths, and
                                scenic walking trails. For more ideas on what to see nearby, check out the "Find

                            <h2 class="card-title">History and Cultural Significance</h2>
                            <p>
                                Noboribetsu Onsen has been celebrated for its healing waters since the Edo period. The
                                area’s nine distinct types of hot spring water are said to cure ailments and promote
                                relaxation. The town’s unique culture blends traditional ryokan hospitality with the
                                wild beauty of Hokkaido’s volcanic landscape. Jigokudani, the “Hell Valley,” is both a
                                natural wonder and a spiritual site, inspiring awe in visitors for centuries.

                            <p>
                                Noboribetsu is famous for its “oni” (demon) folklore. Statues of red and blue oni can be
                                found throughout the town, symbolizing protection and the power of the hot springs. The
                                annual Noboribetsu Hell Festival features lively parades and performances celebrating
                                these mythical guardians.

                                    From <strong>Noboribetsu Station</strong>, take a Donan Bus bound for Noboribetsu
                                    Onsen. The bus ride takes about 15 minutes and drops you in the heart of the onsen
                                    town.
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Tip:</strong> Get off at <em>Ashiyu Iriguchi</em> (“Foot Bath Entrance”) for
                                    easy access to the onsen town.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Access on Foot (From Noboribetsu Station to Onsen Town)</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Walking from Noboribetsu Station to the onsen area is possible but not recommended
                                    due to the steep uphill road (about 6 km, 1.5 hours). The bus is much more
                                    convenient.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once in the onsen town, all major attractions, ryokan, and walking trails are easily
                                    accessible on foot.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Exploring the area on foot is highly recommended for enjoying the fresh air, local
                                    shops, and the dramatic scenery of Jigokudani.
