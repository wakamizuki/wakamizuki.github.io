                            <p>
                                Ueda Castle was originally constructed by Sanada Masayuki in 1583 as a flatland castle.
                                It is renowned for its pivotal role in repelling Tokugawa forces during both the First
                                and Second Battles of Ueda. After the Battle of Sekigahara, the castle was dismantled
                                and Sanada Nobuyuki, Masayuki's son, was transferred to Matsushiro.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today, the Ueda Castle Ruins Park features reconstructed yagura (turrets), gates, and
                                stone walls, allowing visitors to experience the atmosphere of the Sengoku period. The
                                park is a popular destination for history enthusiasts and those seeking to enjoy
                                seasonal beauty, especially during cherry blossom season.
