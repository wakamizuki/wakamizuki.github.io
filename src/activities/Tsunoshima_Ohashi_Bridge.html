                                Tsunoshima Ohashi Bridge (角島大橋) stretches gracefully over the emerald waters of the Sea
                                of Japan, connecting the mainland of Yamaguchi Prefecture to the idyllic island of
                                Tsunoshima. At 1,780 meters long, it’s one of Japan’s longest toll-free bridges and is
                                renowned for its stunning scenery—turquoise seas, white sand beaches, and dramatic
                                coastal views. Whether you drive, cycle, or walk, the bridge offers a breathtaking
                                experience and is a must-see for travelers exploring Japan’s countryside.<br>

                            <p>
                                Opened in 2000, Tsunoshima Ohashi Bridge was built to improve access to Tsunoshima
                                Island and quickly became a symbol of Yamaguchi’s natural beauty. The bridge’s gentle
                                curves and low profile were designed to harmonize with the landscape and minimize
                                environmental impact. Today, it’s a favorite spot for photographers, road trippers, and
                                anyone seeking spectacular ocean views.
