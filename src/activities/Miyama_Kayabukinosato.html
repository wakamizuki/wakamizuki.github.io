                            <p>
                                Miyama Kayabukinosato (美山かやぶきの里) is a picturesque village in the mountains of northern
                                Kyoto, renowned for its collection of over 30 traditional thatched-roof
                                (<em>kayabuki</em>) farmhouses. The village offers a rare glimpse into Japan’s rural
                                past, with beautifully preserved architecture, tranquil countryside scenery, and a
                                peaceful atmosphere. Visitors can stroll the lanes, visit folk museums, and experience
                                the charm of a living heritage site.

                            <p>
                                Miyama Kayabukinosato preserves a way of life that has all but disappeared elsewhere in
                                Japan. The thatched-roof houses, some over 200 years old, are still inhabited and
                                maintained by local residents. The village is recognized as an Important Preservation
                                District for Groups of Traditional Buildings, and its landscape changes beautifully with
                                the seasons—lush green in summer, fiery red in autumn, and snow-white in winter.
