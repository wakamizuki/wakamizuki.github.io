                                Kiga-Sekisho (気賀関所) is a historic checkpoint established by the Tokugawa shogunate in
                                the early 17th century. Located in Kiga, Hamamatsu City, it was
                                set up on the Honzaka Road (Hime Kaido) as a back checkpoint to the main Arai Sekisho on
                                the Tokaido. Its main role was to monitor and control the movement of travelers and
                                goods, especially as an alternate route to the busy Tokaido. Today, visitors can explore
                                restored buildings and exhibits that tell the story of travel and security during the
                                Edo period.
