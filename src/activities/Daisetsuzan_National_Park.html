                                Daisetsuzan National Park (大雪山国立公園) is Hokkaido’s largest and wildest national park,
                                covering a vast area of volcanic mountains, deep gorges, and untouched forests. Known as
                                the “roof of Hokkaido,” it is a paradise for hikers, nature lovers, and onsen
                                enthusiasts. The park is home to Hokkaido’s highest peak, Asahidake, as well as rare
                                alpine flowers, brown bears, and dramatic autumn colors. For more ideas on what to see

                            <p>
                                Daisetsuzan has long been revered by the Ainu people as “Kamui Mintara” (the playground
                                of the gods). The park was established in 1934 to protect its unique alpine ecosystem
                                and volcanic landscapes. Today, it is a symbol of Hokkaido’s wild beauty and a beloved
                                destination for outdoor adventure.
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Since Daisetsuzan National Park is vast, it's hard to pinpoint a single access point. The
                                map below shows access to
                                Asahidake Onsen, one of the most popular entry points.
                                This is an access map for <strong>Asahidake Onsen</strong>, located on the western side
                                of the national park.

                                significance are celebrated in local folklore.
