                            <p>
                                <strong>Note:</strong> To reach Miyanoen Tea Garden from major areas in Tokyo, the basic
                                route is to travel to Takadanobaba Station first, then transfer to the Seibu Ikebukuro
                                Line towards Sayamashi. This is the most convenient way from central Tokyo locations
                                such as Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, and Tokyo Station.
