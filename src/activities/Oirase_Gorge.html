                                Oirase Gorge is a spectacular river valley stretching about 14 kilometers from Lake
                                Towada to Yakeyama in Aomori Prefecture.
                                Famous for its crystal-clear stream, lush forests, and numerous waterfalls, it is a
                                paradise for hikers and nature lovers.
                                The gorge is especially stunning in autumn, when the leaves turn vibrant shades of red
                                and gold.

                            <h2>Visiting Oirase Gorge: What to Know ðŸŒ² (Last updated: May 21, 2025)</h2>
                            <p>
                                Oirase Gorge is ideal for hiking, photography, and enjoying pristine nature.
                                The well-maintained trail follows the stream, passing by waterfalls and mossy rocks.
                                Facilities are available at both ends, but limited along the trail, so bring water and
                                snacks.
                                The area is accessible from late April to November; autumn is especially popular for
                                leaf viewing.
                            </p>
