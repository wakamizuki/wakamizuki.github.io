                                in Daisetsuzan National Park. Surrounded by mountains and forests, the hot spring offers
                                natural mineral baths with beautiful views. It’s the perfect place to unwind after
                                hiking or sightseeing in the area.

                                The onsen water is rich in minerals and is said to help with fatigue and muscle aches.
                                Many inns and hotels offer both indoor and outdoor baths (rotenburo), some with views of
                                the surrounding mountains. Day-use bathing is available at some facilities—perfect for
                                visitors who want to relax after exploring the gorge.

                                Tenninkyo Hot Spring is nestled alongside the Chubetsu River, surrounded by the dramatic
                                columnar cliffs of Daisetsuzan National Park.<br>
                                It is said that Tenninkyo Hot Spring was discovered in 1894 during mineral exploration
                                along the Chubetsu River. In 1897, it was opened as Matsuyama Onsen, named after its
                                discoverer, Tamezo Matsuyama. Later, in 1937, it was renamed Tenninkyo Hot Spring, and
                                the following year, a road for automobiles was completed.<br>
                                Tenninkyo Hot Spring became famous and developed rapidly from the Taisho era to the
                                early Showa period. In the early days, open-air baths clung to the columnar cliffs, and
                                guests would cross a small bridge over the river from their lodgings to reach the
                                baths.<br>
                                Since its opening, the high-quality spring water has been known for its benefits for
                                diabetes and arteriosclerosis. The 100% naturally flowing hot spring is highly regarded
                                by onsen enthusiasts as a hidden gem.<br>
                                Currently, there is one hot spring facility in Tenninkyo, featuring a unique
                                Japanese-style atmosphere. Day-use bathing is available, and many visitors come by car
                                from nearby towns to enjoy a soak, or stop by after descending from the Tomuraushi
                                trailhead in the Daisetsuzan mountains.<br>
                                Some guest rooms offer views of the towering cliffs from the window. This secluded
                                scenic spot is recommended for those who want to spend quiet time listening to the
                                murmuring Chubetsu River flowing nearby.
