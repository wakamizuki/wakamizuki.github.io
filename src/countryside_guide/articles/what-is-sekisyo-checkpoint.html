                                    <strong>Sekisyo</strong> (also written as <strong>sekisho</strong>, 関所) were
                                    official checkpoints established by the Japanese government, especially during the
                                    Edo period (1603–1868). These checkpoints played a crucial role in controlling the
                                    movement of people, goods, and information across the country. Today, they offer a
                                    fascinating glimpse into Japan’s feudal past and the strict travel regulations of
                                    the time.

                                <h3>Definition & Purpose</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A sekisyo was a government-manned barrier or checkpoint located on major roads,
                                    mountain passes, and borders between domains. Their main purposes were:
                                </p>
                                <ul class="pl-3">
                                    <li>To prevent the movement of weapons and suspicious individuals</li>
                                    <li>To control the travel of women, especially the families of feudal lords (daimyo)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>To collect tolls and monitor trade</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    The most famous sekisyo were found on the <strong>Tokaido</strong> and
                                    <strong>Nakasendo</strong> highways, such as the <strong>Hakone Sekisyo</strong> and
                                    <strong>Shinagawa Sekisyo</strong>.
                                </p>
                            </section>

                                <h3>Why Were Sekisyo So Important?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    During the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate enforced strict social order and
                                    security. The <strong>sankin-kotai</strong> system required daimyo to travel
                                    regularly to Edo (Tokyo), and sekisyo checkpoints helped ensure loyalty by
                                    restricting the movement of their families and preventing rebellion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For ordinary people, travel was not a simple matter. Passing through a sekisyo
                                    required official permits, and unauthorized movement could result in severe
                                    punishment. This system shaped the way people experienced travel and contributed to
                                    the unique culture of Japan’s highways and post towns.
                                </p>

                                    <li>Travelers had to present <strong>travel permits</strong> (tegata) at each

                                    <li>Guards inspected baggage for weapons and checked for unauthorized women leaving

                                    <li>Merchants and pilgrims were often questioned about their purpose and

                                    <li>Some sekisyo collected tolls or taxes on goods.</li>

                                        checkpoint was established by the Tokugawa shogunate in the early 17th century
                                        on the Honzaka Road (Hime Kaido) as a secondary checkpoint to Arai Sekisho. It
                                        monitored travelers and goods using alternate routes to the Tokaido. Today,
                                        visitors can explore restored buildings and exhibits about Edo-period travel and

                                <p>
                                    Sekisyo checkpoints were abolished in the late 19th century as Japan modernized, but
                                    their influence remains in literature, art, and preserved historical sites. Visiting
                                    a sekisyo today provides insight into the strict controls and unique travel culture
                                    of Edo-period Japan.
