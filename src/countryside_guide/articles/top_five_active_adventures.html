                                        <b>Overview:</b><br />
                                        Located in Gunma Prefecture, Sarugakyo Bungy offers a thrilling 62-meter jump from a bridge above a river gorge. It's surrounded by nature and delivers a full adrenaline rush.<br />
                                        <b>Why Visit:</b><br />

                                        <b>Things to Know:</b><br />
                                        Participants must be at least 15 years old and weigh between 40–105 kg. You’ll need to fill out a health checklist, and people with certain medical conditions (like epilepsy or heart problems) may not be able to jump. Wear comfortable clothing and closed-toe shoes — no sandals or skirts. Booking in advance is recommended, and don’t forget your ID!
                                    </p>

                                        Most tours require advance reservations and operate from spring to autumn.  
                                        Minimum age or swimming ability may be required depending on the activity (e.g., canyoning or rafting).  
                                        Wear appropriate gear — wetsuits and helmets are usually provided, but bring a towel and change of clothes.
                                    </p>

                                        This dramatic gorge in Miyazaki features sheer cliffs, crystal-clear waters, and a mythical atmosphere. Row a boat through the gorge while waterfalls tumble around you.<br />
                                        <b>Why Visit:</b><br />
                                        It’s a nature adventure that feels like a dream. Paddle beneath waterfalls, hike along the gorge, and soak in the mystical vibes said to be tied to Japanese mythology.<br />
                                        <b>Things to Know:</b><br />
                                        Boat rentals are popular, so arrive early, especially on weekends or holidays.  
                                        Boats can fit up to 3 people, but paddling is manual and requires basic strength.  
                                        Weather and water conditions may affect availability. Wear shoes you don’t mind getting wet!

                                    <p><b>Overview:</b><br />
                                        Japan’s most iconic adventure: climbing to the summit of Mount Fuji (3,776 meters). Most people begin from the 5th Station and hike through the night to catch sunrise at the summit.<br />
                                        <b>Why Visit:</b><br />
                                        Climbing Fuji is a bucket-list challenge that rewards you with breathtaking views and a massive sense of accomplishment. It's safe and achievable with preparation during climbing season (July–September).<br />
                                        <b>Things to Know:</b><br />
                                        Climbing season is typically from early July to early September.  
                                        Wear proper gear — sturdy hiking boots, layered clothing (including waterproof outerwear), gloves, and a headlamp are essential.  
                                        Temperatures drop significantly at higher altitudes, even in summer, and weather can change quickly.  
                                        Reservations for mountain huts are recommended if staying overnight.  
                                        Altitude sickness is common, so take breaks and pace yourself.

                                    <p><b>Overview:</b><br />
                                        Located about 40 km west of Okinawa’s main island, the Kerama Islands are a tropical haven known for crystal-clear waters, coral reefs, and vibrant marine life. The area is part of a national park and offers some of the best snorkeling and diving in Japan.<br />
                                        <b>Why Visit:</b><br />
                                        The Kerama Blue sea is ideal for spotting sea turtles, colorful fish, and stunning coral up close. Easy day tours from Naha make this a must-do for ocean lovers and families wanting a relaxed but unforgettable marine adventure.<br />
                                        <b>Things to Know:</b><br />
                                        Day trips usually depart from Naha by ferry or speedboat — reserve in advance.  
                                        Snorkeling tours may require a short safety briefing and basic swimming ability.  
                                        Sunscreen-safe for coral reefs is encouraged. Don’t touch or step on coral!
