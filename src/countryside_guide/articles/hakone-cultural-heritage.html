                                    <p><b>Overview:</b><br />
                                        Hakone Shrine is a historic Shinto shrine located at the foot of Mount Hakone, along the shores of Lake Ashi. Founded in 757, it has been a center of worship for centuries, attracting samurai, pilgrims, and travelers who sought protection and blessings for their journeys.<br />
                                        <b>Connection with Hakone Mototsumiya:</b><br />
                                        While Hakone Shrine stands beautifully by the lakeside, its spiritual origin lies atop Mount Komagatake at Hakone Mototsumiya. Originally, pilgrims climbed the mountain to worship at this sacred summit shrine. Today, visiting both Hakone Shrine and Hakone Mototsumiya allows you to trace the path of devotion from lake to mountaintop.<br />
                                        <b>Why Visit:</b><br />
                                        Stroll through the tranquil forest paths leading to the main shrine, admire the iconic torii gate rising from Lake Ashi, and soak in the spiritual atmosphere that has inspired generations of worshippers.

                                    <p><b>Overview:</b><br />
                                        Hakone Mototsumiya, meaning "original shrine," sits at the peak of Mount Komagatake. Established as the sacred origin of Hakone Shrine, it offers panoramic views over Hakone and Mount Fuji on clear days.<br />
                                        <b>Connection with Hakone Shrine:</b><br />
                                        Hakone Mototsumiya serves as <strong> inner shrine of Hakone Shrine.</strong>   Historically, pilgrims would first ascend to Mototsumiya before visiting the main shrine by the lake. The two shrines together form a spiritual connection between the mountain and the lake, linking the earth with the heavens.<br />
                                        <b>Why Visit:</b><br />
                                        Take the Komagatake Ropeway to the summit for stunning views and a deep connection to Hakoneâ€™s spiritual heritage.

The site today features reconstructed gates, guardhouses, and exhibits detailing its historical importance.<br />
