                                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Hakone Shrine is a historic Shinto shrine located at the foot of Mount Hakone, along
                                    the shores of Lake Ashi. Founded in 757, it has been a center of worship for
                                    centuries, attracting samurai, pilgrims, and travelers who sought protection and
                                    blessings for their journeys.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Connection with Hakone Mototsumiya:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    While Hakone Shrine stands beautifully by the lakeside, its spiritual origin lies
                                    atop Mount Komagatake at Hakone Mototsumiya. Originally, pilgrims climbed the
                                    mountain to worship at this sacred summit shrine. Today, visiting both Hakone Shrine
                                    and Hakone Mototsumiya allows you to trace the path of devotion from lake to
                                    mountaintop.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Stroll through the tranquil forest paths leading to the main shrine, admire the
                                    iconic torii gate rising from Lake Ashi, and soak in the spiritual atmosphere that
                                    has inspired generations of worshippers.

                                    Hakone Mototsumiya, meaning "original shrine," sits at the peak of Mount Komagatake.
                                    Established as the sacred origin of Hakone Shrine, it offers panoramic views over
                                    Hakone and Mount Fuji on clear days.

                                    Hakone Mototsumiya serves as the inner shrine of Hakone Shrine. Historically,
                                    pilgrims would first ascend to Mototsumiya before visiting the main shrine by the
                                    lake. The two shrines together form a spiritual connection between the mountain and
                                    the lake, linking the earth with the heavens.
                                </p>

                                    The Hakone Checkpoint was one of the most significant security posts along the
                                    Tokaido route during the Edo period. Established by the Tokugawa shogunate, it
                                    monitored travelers and goods moving between regions, playing a key role in
                                    maintaining control over the realm.
