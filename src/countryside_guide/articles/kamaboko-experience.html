                                    Kamaboko, often called "fish cake" in English, is a traditional Japanese food made
                                    from white fish paste. It is steamed or grilled and commonly served in soups, bento
                                    boxes, or as an appetizer.
                                </p>

                                    Located in Odawara, the Suzuhiro Kamaboko Museum offers an engaging experience where
                                    visitors can learn the history of kamaboko, observe the traditional production
                                    process, and even try making their own.

                                <p>
                                    One of the highlights of visiting Suzuhiro is the hands-on kamaboko-making workshop.
                                    With expert guidance, you can shape and cook your own kamaboko and take it home as a
                                    souvenir.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    During the workshop, I had the chance to try making chikuwa, another type of
                                    Japanese fish cake. The process involved evenly wrapping the fish paste around a
                                    bamboo stick, which turned out to be much harder than I expected. It was a fun and
                                    challenging experience that gave me a deeper appreciation for the craftsmanship
                                    involved.

                                    At the museum, you can sample a variety of kamaboko, including grilled, steamed, and

                                    to or from Hakone. Odawara is in Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of Tokyo, making it
                                    easily accessible for a day trip. Reservations are recommended for workshops. Great
                                    for families, foodies, and culture enthusiasts.
